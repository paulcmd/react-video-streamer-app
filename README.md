## Future Improvements:
* Use Redux to manage state instead of prop drilling data down several components.
* Allow user to add products from an add_product page, currently can only be done through a commerce.js account
* Use React.Memo() so that child components don't have to re-render every time their respective parents do. This will further optimize performance.
